Based on my research, the salary for a Python developer with 3 years of experience in Hyderabad, India, varies significantly depending on the source.  Here's a summary of the salary information I found:

* **Indeed:** Reports an average salary of ₹7,52,710 per year.  This is based on a limited number of reported salaries.
* **Glassdoor:** Estimates a total pay of ₹536,000 to ₹546,500 per year, with an average salary between ₹489,000 and ₹500,000 per year.
* **Cutshort:** Shows an average salary of ₹14.8 Lakhs per year.  This number might be an outlier or represent a higher end of the salary range.
* **Other sources (Quora, Reddit, Codegnan):** Provide additional data points, some suggesting a range between ₹7-12 Lakhs, and others mentioning specific companies and their salary offers for this experience level, but these are less systematic than the above.


**Important Note:**  These figures are estimates and may not reflect the actual salary you might receive.  Factors such as company size, specific skills, and individual negotiation skills all play a significant role in determining your final compensation.  For a more comprehensive understanding, I recommend checking job postings on sites like Indeed, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn for the most up-to-date salary information and company reviews.  Sites like AmbitionBox may also provide additional company review information.
