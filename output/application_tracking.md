* **Interview Completed:** Send a thank-you email within 24 hours, reiterating your interest and highlighting key points from the conversation.
* **Offer Received:** Review the offer carefully. Negotiate if necessary.
* **Rejected:**  Thank the interviewer for their time and consideration. Ask for constructive feedback if appropriate.
